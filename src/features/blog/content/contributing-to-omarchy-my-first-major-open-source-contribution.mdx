# Contributing to Omarchy: My First Major Open Source Contribution

When **DHH** (David Heinemeier Hansson) released **Omarchy**—a beautiful, modern, and opinionated Arch Linux distribution—I was immediately captivated. As someone who had been customizing Arch Linux for years, seeing a polished distribution that emphasized aesthetics and developer experience felt like the perfect daily driver.

## Discovery: The HYPE is Real

Omarchy isn't just another Linux distro—it's a **carefully curated experience** built on Arch Linux with Hyprland, designed for developers who value both form and function. When I first saw it trending on Hacker News, I knew I had to try it.

### What Makes Omarchy Special

- **Hyprland compositor** - Smooth, modern Wayland experience
- **Opinionated defaults** - Sensible configurations out of the box
- **Beautiful aesthetics** - Every detail matters
- **Developer-focused** - Built by developers, for developers
- **Active community** - Rapid development and responsive maintainers

## Installation: The Learning Curve

### Initial Challenges

Installing Omarchy on a clean minimal Arch setup wasn't straightforward:

```bash
# Keyring issues were common
sudo pacman -Sy archlinux-keyring
sudo pacman-key --init
sudo pacman-key --populate archlinux

# Package conflicts needed resolution
sudo pacman -Syu --overwrite '*'
```

### The Installation Process

```bash
# Clone the Omarchy repository
git clone https://github.com/omahacodeschool/omarchy.git
cd omarchy

# Run the installation script
./install.sh

# Configure shell (I prefer zsh over fish)
chsh -s /usr/bin/zsh
```

The installation script handles most of the heavy lifting, but understanding what it's doing under the hood helps troubleshoot issues.

## Customization: Making It Mine

### Shell Configuration

One of my first customizations was configuring the **bash shell** to display the current directory path properly:

```bash
# .bashrc customization
PS1='\e[1;34m\u\e[0m@\e[1;32m\h\e[0m:\e[1;33m\w\e[0m$ '

# Show git branch in prompt
parse_git_branch() {
  git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/(\1)/'
}

PS1='\e[1;34m\u\e[0m@\e[1;32m\h\e[0m:\e[1;33m\w\e[0m \e[1;36m$(parse_git_branch)\e[0m$ '
```

### Development Environment Setup

Omarchy comes with great defaults, but I added my development essentials:

```bash
# Install development tools
sudo pacman -S docker docker-compose python nodejs npm

# Docker permissions (common issue)
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker

# Python virtual environments
python -m venv ~/.venvs/default
source ~/.venvs/default/bin/activate

# Node.js setup
npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

### Browser Testing

I experimented with different browsers to find what worked best on Omarchy:

- **Chrome** - My primary browser, works flawlessly
- **Comet browser** - Testing phase, interesting Wayland integration
- **Firefox** - Solid alternative with great Wayland support

## Contributing: Finding My Place

After using Omarchy daily for a few weeks, I noticed areas where I could contribute. The **menu functionality** needed improvements, and I had ideas.

### My First Pull Request

The contribution process was straightforward but taught me valuable lessons about open source collaboration:

#### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omarchy.git
cd omarchy
git remote add upstream https://github.com/omahacodeschool/omarchy.git
```

#### 2. Create a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout -b feature/menu-improvements
```

#### 3. Make Meaningful Changes

I focused on:
- Improving menu navigation
- Adding keyboard shortcuts
- Fixing edge cases in menu behavior
- Enhancing accessibility

#### 4. Test Thoroughly

```bash
# Test on clean Omarchy installation
./test-menu.sh

# Test edge cases
# Test with different screen resolutions
# Test keyboard navigation
```

#### 5. Submit Pull Request

The most nerve-wracking part—putting your code out there for review.

## Code Review: The Real Learning

### Feedback Received

The Omarchy maintainers provided **constructive feedback** that made me a better developer:

1. **Code style consistency** - Following project conventions
2. **Performance considerations** - Optimizing shell scripts
3. **Documentation requirements** - Clear comments and README updates
4. **Testing coverage** - Ensuring changes don't break existing functionality

### Iteration Process

```bash
# Address feedback
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: improve menu performance based on review feedback"

# Keep branch updated
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main

# Push changes
git push origin feature/menu-improvements --force-with-lease
```

### The Merge

When my PR was finally merged, it felt incredible. Seeing my code in a project used by thousands of developers worldwide was validation of months of learning.

## Lessons Learned

### Technical Lessons

1. **Read existing code first** - Understand patterns before contributing
2. **Small PRs are better** - Easier to review and merge
3. **Tests matter** - Untested code will be rejected
4. **Documentation is code** - Update docs with every change

### Collaboration Lessons

1. **Be responsive** - Address feedback promptly
2. **Stay humble** - Maintainers know the codebase better
3. **Ask questions** - Better to clarify than assume
4. **Be patient** - Reviews take time

### Community Insights

The Omarchy community taught me:
- **Respect maintainer decisions** - They have a vision
- **Contribute consistently** - One-off PRs are great, but regular contributions build trust
- **Help others** - Answer issues, help newcomers
- **Share experiences** - Blog posts and tutorials help the ecosystem

## Omarchy in My Daily Workflow

### Development Setup

```bash
# Morning routine
cd ~/projects/skinseoul
code . # VS Code/Cursor
docker-compose up -d
npm run dev
```

### Productivity Tools

Omarchy's Wayland/Hyprland setup with proper configurations made my workflow seamless:

- **Rofi** - Application launcher
- **Waybar** - Status bar
- **Kitty/Alacritty** - Terminal emulators
- **Docker** - Containerized development

### Gaming on Omarchy

Yes, Omarchy handles gaming well! **CS2** (Counter-Strike 2) runs smoothly with proper graphics drivers.

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Package Conflicts

```bash
# Solution: Use overwrite flag carefully
sudo pacman -S package-name --overwrite '/path/to/conflicting/file'
```

### 2. Docker Permission Issues

```bash
# Solution: Proper group setup
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in
```

### 3. Python Version Management

Building Python from source when needed:

```bash
# Build Python 3.12
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/Python-3.12.0.tgz
tar -xf Python-3.12.0.tgz
cd Python-3.12.0
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make altinstall
```

## The Broader Impact

Contributing to Omarchy opened doors:

- **Confidence in open source** - Now I contribute to other projects regularly
- **Better code quality** - Code review taught me best practices
- **Community connections** - Met amazing developers
- **Portfolio piece** - Demonstrates real-world collaboration skills

## Ethical Considerations

It's worth noting that while Omarchy is technically impressive, there have been **discussions about the ethics** around its branding and positioning in the Linux community. These conversations are important and show that open source isn't just about code—it's about community values and respect for existing work.

## What's Next?

I'm planning to:

- **Continue contributing** to Omarchy's development
- **Document my configurations** to help others
- **Build tools** that enhance the Omarchy experience
- **Help newcomers** get started with the distro

## Advice for Aspiring Contributors

If you want to contribute to open source projects like Omarchy:

1. **Use the project daily** - You'll find real issues to fix
2. **Start small** - Documentation and bug fixes are valuable
3. **Read contributing guidelines** - Every project has standards
4. **Be professional** - Treat it like a real job
5. **Don't give up** - First PRs are often rejected—learn and try again
6. **Build in public** - Share your journey on GitHub and blogs

## Key Takeaways

- Omarchy is a beautiful, developer-focused Linux distribution worth trying
- Open source contribution is accessible to everyone
- Code review feedback makes you a better developer
- Community involvement enhances technical skills
- Daily usage reveals contribution opportunities
- Small, consistent contributions matter more than big one-offs

Omarchy transformed how I think about Linux distributions and open source contribution. It's not just a distro—it's a community of developers building something exceptional together.
