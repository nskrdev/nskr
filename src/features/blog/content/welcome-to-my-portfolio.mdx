# Welcome to My Portfolio

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the structure and format for your own blog content. You can replace this with your own posts or delete it entirely if you don't want to include a blog section.

## Getting Started with Blog Posts

Each blog post is written in MDX format, which allows you to combine Markdown with React components. Here's what you need to know:

### Frontmatter Structure

Every blog post should start with frontmatter containing:

- `title`: The post title
- `description`: A brief description for SEO and previews
- `image`: Optional OG image URL (defaults to `/og/simple`)
- `category`: Optional category for filtering posts
- `icon`: Optional icon name (Lucide icons supported)
- `new`: Optional flag to show a "New" badge
- `createdAt`: Creation date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `updatedAt`: Last updated date (YYYY-MM-DD format)

### File Naming

Blog post files should be named using kebab-case and end with `.mdx`. The filename (without extension) becomes the URL slug.

### Content

You can use standard Markdown syntax along with React components. The portfolio includes several custom components you can use in your posts.

## Next Steps

1. Replace this post with your own content
2. Create additional posts following the same structure
3. Update the frontmatter with your own metadata
4. Delete this file if you don't want to include a blog

Happy writing!
