  about: `
Hello, World! I am Narra Suryakoushik Reddy (Red) â€” an aspiring AI Engineer and DevOps enthusiast passionate about intelligent automation and machine learning systems.

Currently pursuing my Master of Computer Application at Lovely Professional University, I specialize in AI agent development, workflow automation with n8n, and deploying production-grade ML solutions on AWS. As a former AI Agent Innovations Intern at Skin Seoul, Singapore, I automated 20+ API integrations, achieving 98% workflow success rates and reducing manual tasks by 40%.

My technical expertise spans Python, TensorFlow, Keras, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud infrastructure. I've built projects ranging from real-time dance pose analysis APIs to AI-powered resume intelligence systems with 96% accuracy. I'm also an active open-source contributor to projects like Omarchy, adding fuzzy search functionality to enhance Linux menu systems.

Beyond code, I'm passionate about exploring the intersection of AI and DevOps, building autonomous disaster response agents, and creating intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. I work extensively with n8n for enterprise automation, integrating platforms like WooCommerce, Klaviyo, and Google Sheets to streamline operations.

Check out my projects on GitHub (github.com/nskrdev) including DanceMoveInsight, ARISE, and my contributions to open-source Linux tools. I hold certifications from HarvardX (Data Science Capstone), Microsoft (System Administration), and CompTIA (Ethical Hacking).

Let's connect and collaborate on building the future of intelligent automation!
